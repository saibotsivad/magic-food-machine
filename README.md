# magic-food-machine

An idea I have for a magical machine that makes all kinds of foods.

So basically you have this machine that can make all sorts of kinds
of food. Like a bread machine or something, but more food-universal.

I've got a bunch of notes, and now I'm making some 3d models so I
can print them on my 3d printer.

The goal is to have it so people can make their own if they want.

Another goal is to use normal foods, so you can refill your cartridges
with, say, raw beans from any old store. As opposed to requiring very
specialty foods or pre-filled cartridges somehow.
